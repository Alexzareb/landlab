A Quick Tutorial Introduction to Landlab
========================================

Landlab is a Python software package that supports numerical modeling in earth science, and especially those fields that deal with earth-surface dynamics, including geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, stratigraphy, and related areas. Landlab provides four main resources and capabilities:

(1) A library of *code resources* for building two-dimensional numerical models from scratch. The Landlab library includes a powerful ``gridding engine'' for creating, managing, and iteratively updating data on structured or unstructured grids. The library also includes support for input and output, including input of digital elevation models (DEMs) in ArcInfo ASCII format, handling of parameter inputs using formatted text files, and netCDF-format input and output.

(2) A set of pre-built *components*, each of which implements a numerical representation of a particular process.

(3) A *framework for building models* by assembling and linking process components.

(4) A *library of models* that have already been created from component(s).

This guide provides a quick tour of some of Landlab's main features and capabilities. Each of the sections below also provides references to additional documentation, where interested users and developers can learn more.
