Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q: How do I set the boundary codes for the edges of a grid?**

*A: By default, the boundary nodes around the perimeter of a grid are all
open boundaries. For a raster grid, if you want to make one or more sides closed boundaries, use the
grid method set_inactive_boundaries(). Some other grid methods that deal with boundaries 
include the following: set_fixed_value_boundaries(), set_nodata_nodes_to_inactive()*
