About The Landlab
=================

The Landlab project creates an environment in which scientists can build a
numerical landscape model without having to code all of the individual
components. Landscape models compute flows of mass, such as water, sediment,
glacial ice, volcanic material, or landslide debris, across a gridded terrain
surface. Landscape models have a number of commonalities, such as operating
on a grid of points and routing material across the grid. Scientists who want
to use a landscape model often build their own unique model from the ground
up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their landscape model rather than
taking advantage of codes that have already been written.
