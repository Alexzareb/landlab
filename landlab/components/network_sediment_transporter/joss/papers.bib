    abstract = {The movement of sediment from source to sink in a watershed is a complex process with multiple interactions and feedbacks across scales. At small scales, the size characteristics of a sediment mixture affect the transport of that sediment through hiding and through the nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport. At large scales, the channel network itself, through network geometry and the spatial pattern of transport capacity, adds additional complexity in organizing sediment moving through the system such that aggradational hotspots can emerge. The purpose of this paper is to present a Lagrangian framework for exploring complexities of mixed-size sediment transport in gravel-bedded river networks. The present model builds off of previous network-based, bed-material sediment transport models; but key advancements presented herein (i) allow for a mixture of sediment sizes in the river network, (ii) incorporate a mixed-size sediment transport equation, and (iii) utilize a daily flow hydrograph to drive intermittent transport. The model is applied to the roughly 4700 km2Methow River Basin in Washington State, USA, using simplified model inputs with the goal of illustrating the utility of the model for motivating future work.},
