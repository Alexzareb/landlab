    abstract = {The movement of sediment from source to sink in a watershed is a complex process with multiple interactions and feedbacks across scales. At small scales, the size characteristics of a sediment mixture affect the transport of that sediment through hiding and through the nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport. At large scales, the channel network itself, through network geometry and the spatial pattern of transport capacity, adds additional complexity in organizing sediment moving through the system such that aggradational hotspots can emerge. The purpose of this paper is to present a Lagrangian framework for exploring complexities of mixed-size sediment transport in gravel-bedded river networks. The present model builds off of previous network-based, bed-material sediment transport models; but key advancements presented herein (i) allow for a mixture of sediment sizes in the river network, (ii) incorporate a mixed-size sediment transport equation, and (iii) utilize a daily flow hydrograph to drive intermittent transport. The model is applied to the roughly 4700 km2Methow River Basin in Washington State, USA, using simplified model inputs with the goal of illustrating the utility of the model for motivating future work.},

abstract = {Abstract The morphology of an alluvial river channel affects the movement of water and sediment along it, but in the longer run is shaped by those processes. This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.},

abstract = {Abstract Understanding how sediment moves along source to sink pathways through watersheds—from hillslopes to channels and in and out of floodplains—is a fundamental problem in geomorphology. We contribute to advancing this understanding by modeling the transport and in-channel storage dynamics of bed material sediment on a river network over a 600 year time period. Specifically, we present spatiotemporal changes in bed sediment thickness along an entire river network to elucidate how river networks organize and process sediment supply. We apply our model to sand transport in the agricultural Greater Blue Earth River Basin in Minnesota. By casting the arrival of sediment to links of the network as a Poisson process, we derive analytically (under supply-limited conditions) the time-averaged probability distribution function of bed sediment thickness for each link of the river network for any spatial distribution of inputs. Under transport-limited conditions, the analytical assumptions of the Poisson arrival process are violated (due to in-channel storage dynamics) where we find large fluctuations and periodicity in the time series of bed sediment thickness. The time series of bed sediment thickness is the result of dynamics on a network in propagating, altering, and amalgamating sediment inputs in sometimes unexpected ways. One key insight gleaned from the model is that there can be a small fraction of reaches with relatively low-transport capacity within a nonequilibrium river network acting as “bottlenecks” that control sediment to downstream reaches, whereby fluctuations in bed elevation can dissociate from signals in sediment supply.},

abstract = {Abstract Wildfires represent one of the largest disturbances in watersheds of the Intermountain West. Yet, we lack models capable of predicting post-wildfire impacts on downstream ecosystems and infrastructure. Here we present a novel modeling framework that links new and existing models to simulate the post-wildfire sediment cascade, including spatially explicit predictions of debris flows, storage of debris flow sediment within valleys, delivery of debris flow sediment to active channels, and the downstream routing of sediment through river networks. We apply the model to sediment dynamics in Clear Creek watershed following the 2010 Twitchell Canyon Fire in the Tushar Mountains of southern Utah. The debris flow generation model performed well, correctly predicting 19 out of 20 debris flows from the largest catchments, with only four false positives and two false negatives at observed rainfall intensities. In total, the model predicts the occurrence of 160 post-wildfire debris flows across the Clear Creek watershed, generating more than 650 000 m3 of sediment. Our new storage and delivery model predicts the vast majority of this sediment is stored within valleys, and only 13\% is delivered to the river network. The sediment routing model identifies numerous sediment bottlenecks within the network, which alter transport dynamics and may be hotspots for aggradation and aquatic habitat alteration. The volume of sediment exported from the watershed after seven years of simulation totals 17\% of that delivered, or 2\% of the total generated debris flow sediment. In the case of the Twitchell Canyon Fire, this highlights that significant post-wildfire sediment volumes can be stored in valleys (87\%) and within the stream network (11\%). Finally, we discuss useful insights that can be gleaned from the model framework, as well as the limitations and need for more monitoring and theory development in order to better constrain essential inputs, process rates, and morphodynamics. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the application of The Unified Gravel-Sand (TUGS) model for the simulation of the Sandy River, Oregon. TUGS model employs Wilcock and Crowe's (2003) bedload transport equation for simulation of gravel and sand transport, and is capable of simulating the dynamics of bed material grain size distributions, including the fractions of sand in the deposits. The model has been examined with three large-scale flume experiments and a flushing flow flume experiment with good agreements in bed profiles, gravel characteristic grain sizes and fractions of sand in the deposits. These examinations, along with descriptions of model development, are presented in a manuscript submitted concomitantly elsewhere (Cui, 2007), and this paper expands model examinations to a natural river. Eight runs are conducted with the Sandy River, Oregon as the prototype river, focusing on the responses of bed material grain size distributions under different hydrologic and sediment supply conditions. Simulation with the recorded discharge and the best understanding of sediment supply in the Sandy River produced good agreement in river longitudinal profile. This simulation also produced decreased median grain size and increased sand fraction in the downstream direction that match well with the general observations in the field. Examinations with varied sand supply indicate that bed material sand fractions are positively correlated with sand supply. Examinations with varied water discharge indicate that increased discharge under the same sediment supply conditions results in decreased bed material sand fraction. Examination of a hypothetical backwater effect from the Columbia River indicates that backwater effect results in increases in bed material sand fractions. Simulation of the sedimentation process upstream of a 14-m tall dam during dam operation produced similar current bed profile and a stratified sediment deposit very similar to those observed in the field.

abstract = {This paper presents The Unified Gravel-Sand (TUGS) model that simulates the transport, erosion, and deposition of both gravel and sand. TUGS model employs the surface-based bed load equation of Wilcock and Crowe (2003) and links grain size distributions in the bed load, surface layer, and subsurface with the gravel transfer function of Hoey and Ferguson (1994) and Toro-Escobar et al. (1996), a hypothetical sand transfer function, and hypothetical functions for sand entrainment/infiltration from/into the subsurface. The model is capable of exploring the dynamics of grain size distributions, including the fractions of sand in sediment deposits and on the channel bed surface, and is potentially useful in exploring gravel-sand transitions and reservoir sedimentation processes. Simulation of three sets of large-scale flume experiments indicates that the model, with minor adjustment to the Wilcock-Crowe equation, excellently reproduced bed profile and grain size distributions of the sediment deposits, including the fractions of sand within the deposits. Simulation of a flushing flow experiment indicated that the sand entrainment function is potentially capable of simulating the short-term processes such as flushing flow events.},
